### Fields

| Key      | Format                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| `server` | List of [DNS Server](./server/) |
| `rules`  | List of [DNS Rule](./rule/)     |
| `fakeip` | :material-note-remove: [FakeIP](./fakeip/) |

#### final

Default dns server tag.

The first server will be used if empty.

#### strategy

Default domain strategy for resolving the domain names.

One of `prefer_ipv4` `prefer_ipv6` `ipv4_only` `ipv6_only`.

#### disable_cache

Disable dns cache.

Conflict with `optimistic`.

#### disable_expire

Disable dns cache expire.

Conflict with `optimistic`.

#### independent_cache

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.14.0"

    `independent_cache` is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.14.0, check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-independent-dns-cache).

Make each DNS server's cache independent for special purposes. If enabled, will slightly degrade performance.

#### round_robin_cache

Make the order of cached response addresses rotated in round robin manner.

#### cache_capacity

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.11.0"

LRU cache capacity.

Value less than 1024 will be ignored.

#### cache_client_subnet

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.12.25-reF1nd.2 / 1.13.15-reF1nd / 1.14.0-alpha.38-reF1nd"

Allow storing responses for DNS queries received from clients that contain an EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) option. If the upstream response contains an ECS option, it is preserved in the cached response.

Disabled by default. When disabled, matching existing ECS cache entries can still be used, but cache misses are not stored and stale entries are not refreshed. This option does not affect `client_subnet` configured by sing-box itself, whose responses are cached using the configured prefix as part of the cache key.

Each distinct ECS prefix creates an independent cache entry. Enabling this option can significantly increase both in-memory DNS cache usage and the size of the persistent DNS cache file. Do not enable it for DNS listeners accessible by untrusted clients unless the cache expiration policy and listener exposure are carefully controlled. Enabling it together with `disable_expire` prevents persistent ECS cache entries from expiring automatically.

#### min_cache_ttl

Minimum DNS cache TTL in seconds.

TTL values below this value are increased before a response is cached and returned.

`0` disables the minimum TTL limit.

#### max_cache_ttl

Maximum DNS cache TTL in seconds.

TTL values above this value are reduced before a response is cached and returned.

`0` disables the maximum TTL limit. Leaving both options unset preserves the TTL derived from the DNS response.

If `min_cache_ttl` is greater than a non-zero `max_cache_ttl`, `min_cache_ttl` is used as both limits.

A rule-level `rewrite_ttl` action is applied after these limits and takes precedence over them.

#### optimistic

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.14.0"

Enable optimistic DNS caching. When a cached DNS entry has expired but is still within the timeout window,
the stale response is returned immediately while a background refresh is triggered.

Conflict with `disable_cache` and `disable_expire`.

Accepts a boolean or an object. When set to `true`, the default timeout of `3d` is used.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "timeout": "3d"
}
```

##### enabled

Enable optimistic DNS caching.

##### timeout

The maximum time an expired cache entry can be served optimistically.

`3d` is used by default.

#### timeout

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.14.0"

Default timeout for each DNS query.

`10s` is used by default.

Can be overridden by `rules.[].timeout` (DNS rule action) or `domain_resolver.timeout`.

#### reverse_mapping

Stores a reverse mapping of IP addresses after responding to a DNS query in order to provide domain names when routing.

Since this process relies on the act of resolving domain names by an application before making a request, it can be
problematic in environments such as macOS, where DNS is proxied and cached by the system.

#### client_subnet

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.9.0"

Append a `edns0-subnet` OPT extra record with the specified IP prefix to every query by default.

If value is an IP address instead of prefix, `/32` or `/128` will be appended automatically.

Can be overridden by `servers.[].client_subnet` or `rules.[].client_subnet`.
